# Vue 3 + Vite + Static Site Generation

This is a minimal boilerplate for Vue 3 and Vite. It comes with Vuex and Vue Router along with my favourite featues from Nuxt, auto imported components and auto generated routes. Just install and get to work. ðŸš€

### Tools used for automations

[Unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components) For components 
[Vite Plugin Pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages) For pages

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production
$ npm run build
```
